This package is a set of tools to use RStudio it prevents the IDE to restart each time you change active project.

## Issues with rhino

+ Hard to set up with renv()
+ Workaround I think I've found and that I'm gonna test again:
  - Install `consoleR` and `keyboardShortcutAddin`
  - Create rhino app with rhino::init()
  - Install my packages with renv::install()
  - Each time you switch project => hard restart a session CTRL+F10
