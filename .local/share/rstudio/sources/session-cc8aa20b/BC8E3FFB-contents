This package is a set of tools to use RStudio it prevents the IDE to restart each time you change active project.

## Issues with rhino

+ Hard to set up with renv()
+ Workaround I think I've found and that I'm gonna test again:
  - Install `consoleR` and `keyboardShortcutAddin`
  - Create rhino app with rhino::init()
  - Install my packages with renv::install()
  - Each time you switch project => hard restart a session CTRL+F10
+ I've created a function `install_my_packages_inside_rhino`
  - TODO create a `create_rhino_app` that will use:
    - `rhino::init()` and then `install_my_packages_inside_rhino`
